An Intelligence Community (IC) professional since 2012, I offer more than a decade of experience providing DoD & Agency personnel with analytic supportâ€”CONUS & OCONUS, including 556 days in Afghanistan.

My interests vary beyond intelligence, and through a combination of formal education and self-study I have acquired a broad range of knowledge & skills. BLUF.blog serves as the repository for all of my shared projects, writings, and ideas.

Presently, my time is spent learning various coding applications, and establishing a vegetable garden on the property I care for. Additionally, I am in the beginning stages of breeding a novel cultivar of basil.
